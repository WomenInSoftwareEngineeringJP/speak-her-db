# Contributor Guidelines ℹ

Welcome and thanks for your interest in contributing to our project. 🙇‍♀️

## What to work on 🛠

The tag "good first issue" and "help wanted" highlights some tickets that we'd love help with. Feel free to drop us a note if you'd like to work on these, especially if you'd like to tackle a more complex issue where it might be helpful to discuss approach. For privacy reasons, we don't allow Airtable access to the general public, but we're happy to answer questions about the table structure for contributors.

Please check with us before working on tickets in the "Icebox / Ideas" column or with the "backburner" label. Please also check before working on a ticket already assigned to somebody.

## Using git

We prefer merges instead of rebasing. Merges to master will be squashed. Please don't use `force-push` as it messes with Pull request comments and makes it hard for others to look at your branch.

## Approval process ✅

All PRs must be approved by Code Owners. It helps us verify your code faster when there are good notes and tests (or reproducible steps for manual tests). Please follow the template and explain your ticket in the PR description so we can understand your changes. If you're changing the UI, screenshots for desktop and mobile view are appreciated. 

## Code style 📝

Please set up your editor to use [eslint](https://eslint.org/). We don't use Prettier or other formatters at this point.

## Style & UI 🎨

1. We use Material Design via the [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) framework for this site.

2. Icons should be selected from the [Material Icon Set (Filled)](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline), with a few exceptions where social media icons may be taken from FontAwesome.

3. Please ensure new features support Responsive Design (friendly to mobile, tablet, desktop, etc.).

4. We love mockups and paper prototypes, so if you have a suggestion and can sketch your idea, that's helpful.

Please ask @ann-kilzer if you have questions!

## Translations 🌐

We're building infrastructure to enable faster translation to other languages. Please stay tuned. In the meantime, we appreciate translations from fluent  or native speakers, but please do not submit machine translations to our project.
